## Introduction to Acceptance Testing

**Acceptance Testing** is the final phase of the testing process before a release is deployed. It involves testing the software from the end-user's perspective to determine whether it meets the specified requirements and is ready for deployment.

### Why Is Acceptance Testing Useful?

- **Ensures Correct Functionality**: Verifies that all features work as intended and meet business needs.
- **Validates Integration**: Confirms that the software integrates well with existing systems and workflows.
- **Reduces Miscommunication**: Minimizes misunderstandings between developers and stakeholders by validating requirements.
- **Improves Usability**: Identifies usability issues that may not have been apparent during earlier testing phases.
- **Encourages Collaboration**: Promotes continuous collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

---

## Acceptance Testing and End-to-End Testing

Acceptance testing often involves end-to-end (E2E) scenarios to validate that the system meets business requirements in real-world conditions.

- **Acceptance Testing**: Focuses on the user perspective, ensuring the system meets user needs and acceptance criteria.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Focuses on the technical correctness of workflows across integrated components.

---

## Introduction to BDD

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is an Agile software development methodology that enhances collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on specifying the behavior of the application from the user's perspective.

### Key Principles

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Use a common language understood by all stakeholders to minimize miscommunication.
- **Executable Specifications**: Write tests that serve as both documentation and verification of the system's behavior.

---

## BDD as an Extension of TDD

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development approach where developers write unit tests before writing the actual code.

- **TDD Cycle**: **Write a failing test ➔ Write code to pass the test ➔ Refactor the code**.
- **Focus**: Primarily on the **internal logic and code functionality**.

**BDD extends TDD by:**

- Focusing on **user stories** and **acceptance criteria**.
- Writing tests in a natural language format using **Gherkin syntax**.
- Involving **business stakeholders** in the testing process.

### User Stories

- **Definition**: A user story is a simple description of a feature from the end-user's perspective.
- **Format**: Often written as:
  - *As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/value].*
- **Purpose**: Captures the **who**, **what**, and **why** of a requirement.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Definition**: Specific conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user or stakeholder.
- **Purpose**: Define the **boundaries** of a user story and what is needed for it to be considered complete.

**Example:**

**User Story**:

- *As a train operator, I want to assess train capacity so that I can ensure passenger safety and comfort.*

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. The system calculates total capacity based on train type and number of carriages.
2. The system determines if the number of passengers exceeds capacity.
3. The system provides a "Sufficient" or "Insufficient" capacity status.
4. Different train types have specific capacities per carriage.

### Comparison of TDD and BDD

| Aspect                  | TDD                                  | BDD                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Focus**               | Code functionality                   | System behavior                       |
| **Language**            | Programming language (e.g., Python)  | Natural language (e.g., English)      |
| **Stakeholder Involvement** | Developers                       | Developers, QA, Business Analysts     |

## What Is Behave?

**Behave** is an open-source BDD framework for Python that allows you to write tests in a natural language style using the **Gherkin syntax**.

### Key Features

- **Gherkin Syntax**: Write test scenarios in plain English.
- **Python Step Definitions**: Implement test steps in Python.
- **Acceptance Testing Support**: Validate the system from the user's perspective, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## Understanding Gherkin Syntax and Step Definitions

### Gherkin Syntax

Gherkin is a domain-specific language for writing test scenarios in plain English. It uses keywords like `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`, and `Scenario Outline`.

**Example Feature File (`train_capacity.feature`):**

```gherkin
Feature: Train Capacity Assessment

  Scenario: Assess capacity for a Tube train
    Given a "Tube" train with 6 carriages
    When 168 passengers are onboard
    Then the train should have "Sufficient" capacity
```

### Step Definitions

Step definitions are Python functions that Behave uses to execute the steps in your feature files. They are linked to Gherkin steps using decorators like `@given`, `@when`, `@then`, `@and`, and `@but`.

**Example Step Definitions (`train_capacity_steps.py`):**

```python
from behave import given, when, then  # type: ignore

@given('a "{train_type}" train with {carriages:d} carriages')
def step_given_train(context, train_type, carriages):
    context.train = Train(train_type, carriages)

@when('{passengers:d} passengers are onboard')
def step_when_passengers_onboard(context, passengers):
    context.result = context.train.calculate_capacity(passengers)
    context.passengers = passengers

@then('the train should have "{expected_capacity}" capacity')
def step_then_train_capacity(context, expected_capacity):
    assert context.result == expected_capacity, f"Expected {expected_capacity} but got {context.result}"
```

### Placeholders and Format Specifiers

Placeholders in step definitions allow you to capture dynamic values from your Gherkin steps. Format specifiers define the type of the captured value.

**Common Format Specifiers:**

| Specifier | Type     | Description                              |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `:d`      | Integer  | Matches whole numbers (e.g., `42`)       |
| `:f`      | Float    | Matches decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`)   |
| `:s`      | String   | Matches any text (e.g., `"Hello"`)       |
| `:bool`   | Boolean  | Matches `True` or `False` (case-insensitive) |

**Example:**

- **Gherkin Step:**

  ```gherkin
  Given a "Tube" train with 6 carriages
  ```

- **Step Definition:**

  ```python
  @given('a "{train_type}" train with {carriages:d} carriages')
  def step_given_train(context, train_type, carriages):
      # train_type is a string, carriages is an integer
      pass
  ```

### Data Tables in Gherkin Steps

Data tables allow you to provide structured data within your Gherkin steps.

**Example Gherkin Step with Data Table:**

```gherkin
Given the following train setups:
    | train_type      | carriages | passengers |
    | Tube            | 6         | 168        |
    | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 200        |
    | Eurostar        | 2         | 150        |
```

**Step Definition:**

```python
@given('the following train setups')
def step_given_train_setups(context):
    context.trains = []
    for row in context.table:
        train = Train(row['train_type'], int(row['carriages']))
        passengers = int(row['passengers'])
        context.trains.append((train, passengers))
```

**Explanation:**

- `context.table` represents the data table provided in the Gherkin step.
- We initialize `context.trains` as an empty list to store train configurations.
- We loop through each row in the table to create `Train` instances and store them along with the number of passengers.

### Scenario Outlines and Examples

Scenario Outlines allow you to run the same scenario multiple times with different inputs.

**Example Scenario Outline:**

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Assess train capacity with different train types
  Given a "<train_type>" train with <carriages> carriages
  When <passengers> passengers are onboard
  Then the train should have "<expected_capacity>" capacity

  Examples:
    | train_type      | carriages | passengers | expected_capacity |
    | Tube            | 6         | 168        | Sufficient        |
    | Tube            | 6         | 170        | Insufficient      |
    | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 200        | Sufficient        |
    | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 250        | Insufficient      |
    | Eurostar        | 2         | 150        | Sufficient        |
    | Eurostar        | 2         | 170        | Insufficient      |
```

**Explanation:**

- Placeholders like `<train_type>` are replaced with values from the `Examples` table.
- Each row in the `Examples` table represents a different test case.

### Tags in Behave

Tags allow you to categorize and selectively run scenarios.

- **Syntax:** Place `@tag_name` above a `Feature`, `Scenario`, or `Scenario Outline`.

**Example:**

```gherkin
@train_capacity
Feature: Train Capacity Assessment
```

**Running Tagged Scenarios:**

```bash
behave --tags=@train_capacity
```

## BDD Implementation Example

Let's walk through a practical example to solidify your understanding.

### Feature File Explained

**Feature File (`train_capacity.feature`):**

```gherkin
@train_capacity
Feature: Train Capacity Assessment

  # This feature ensures we can assess the capacity of different trains
  # and their carriages to determine if they can accommodate passengers

  # Remember:
  # - Tube has 28 seats per carriage
  # - SouthWestRail has 50 seats per carriage
  # - Eurostar has 80 seats per carriage

  Scenario: Calculate capacity for a single train

    Given a "Tube" train with 6 carriages
    When 160 passengers are onboard
    Then the train should have "Sufficient" capacity

  Scenario Outline: Assess train capacity with different train types

    Given a "<train_type>" train with <carriages> carriages
    When <passengers> passengers are onboard
    Then the train should have "<expected_capacity>" capacity

    Examples:
      | train_type      | carriages | passengers | expected_capacity |
      | Tube            | 6         | 168        | Sufficient        |
      | Tube            | 6         | 170        | Insufficient      |
      | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 200        | Sufficient        |
      | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 250        | Insufficient      |
      | Eurostar        | 2         | 150        | Sufficient        |
      | Eurostar        | 2         | 170        | Insufficient      |

  Scenario: Assess train capacity with additional conditions

    Given a "Tube" train with 6 carriages
    When 170 passengers are onboard
    Then the train should have "Insufficient" capacity
    But an additional carriage can be added to accommodate the passengers

  Scenario: Assess multiple train capacities
    Given the following train setups:
      | train_type      | carriages | passengers |
      | Tube            | 6         | 168        |
      | SouthWestRail   | 4         | 200        |
      | Eurostar        | 2         | 150        |
    When the trains are assessed for capacity
    Then the results should be:
      | train_type      | capacity    |
      | Tube            | Sufficient  |
      | SouthWestRail   | Sufficient  |
      | Eurostar        | Sufficient  |
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature**: Describes the high-level functionality being tested—in this case, "Train Capacity Assessment."
- **Scenarios**: Different test cases covering various aspects of train capacity assessment.
- **Comments**: Provide additional context and reminders about train capacities.

### Step Definitions Explained

**Step Definitions (`train_capacity_steps.py`):**

```python
from behave import given, when, then  # type: ignore
from src.service.MyTrainApp import Train

# Create a Train instance for the specified type of train and number of carriages
@given('a "{train_type}" train with {carriages:d} carriages')
def step_given_train(context, train_type, carriages):
    # We create an instance of a Train and store it in context.train
    context.train = Train(train_type, carriages)

# Calculate train capacity with the specified number of passengers
@when('{passengers:d} passengers are onboard')
def step_when_passengers_onboard(context, passengers):
    # Calculate whether the train can accommodate the passengers using calculate_capacity
    context.result = context.train.calculate_capacity(passengers)
    context.passengers = passengers  # Store passengers for use in subsequent steps

# Verify if the train has sufficient or insufficient capacity
@then('the train should have "{expected_capacity}" capacity')
def step_then_train_capacity(context, expected_capacity):
    # Assert that the result matches the expected capacity (e.g., "Sufficient" or "Insufficient")
    assert context.result == expected_capacity, f"Expected {expected_capacity} but got {context.result}"

# Verify if adding a carriage would make capacity sufficient
@then('an additional carriage can be added to accommodate the passengers')
def step_then_add_carriage(context):
    # Simulate adding one additional carriage and recalculate the capacity
    additional_carriages = 1
    train = context.train
    total_capacity = (train.carriages + additional_carriages) * train.capacity_per_carriage[train.train_type]
    assert context.passengers <= total_capacity, (
        "Even with an additional carriage, capacity is insufficient"
    )

# Store train setups from a table
@given('the following train setups')
def step_given_train_setups(context):
    context.trains = []
    for row in context.table:
        train = Train(row['train_type'], int(row['carriages']))
        passengers = int(row['passengers'])
        context.trains.append((train, passengers))

# Assess capacity for multiple trains
@when('the trains are assessed for capacity')
def step_when_assess_multiple_trains(context):
    # We iterate over the stored train configurations, calculate the capacity for each, and store the results
    context.results = []
    for train, passengers in context.trains:
        result = train.calculate_capacity(passengers)
        context.results.append({"train_type": train.train_type, "capacity": result})

# Verify capacity results for multiple trains using a table
@then('the results should be:')
def step_then_assess_results(context):
    # Compare the actual results with the expected results
    for actual, expected in zip(context.results, context.table):
        assert actual["capacity"] == expected["capacity"], (
            f"Expected {expected['capacity']} but got {actual['capacity']} for train type {actual['train_type']}"
        )
```

**Explanation:**

- **`context.train`**:

  - We store the `Train` instance in `context.train` to make it accessible across steps within the same scenario.

- **`context.result`**:

  - Stores the result of the capacity calculation (e.g., "Sufficient" or "Insufficient") for comparison in the `Then` step.

- **`context.trains`**:

  - An array to store multiple `Train` instances along with their passenger counts, used in the scenario assessing multiple trains.

- **Calculating Additional Capacity**:

  - In the step `@then('an additional carriage can be added to accommodate the passengers')`, we simulate adding one carriage and recalculate capacity to verify if the train can now accommodate the passengers.

### Application Code Explained

**Train Class (`MyTrainApp.py`):**

```python
class Train:
    def __init__(self, train_type, carriages):
        self.train_type = train_type
        self.carriages = carriages

        # Dictionary storing the seating capacity per carriage for different types of trains
        self.capacity_per_carriage = {
            "Tube": 28,
            "SouthWestRail": 50,
            "Eurostar": 80
        }

        # Validate the train type
        if train_type not in self.capacity_per_carriage:
            valid_types = ', '.join(self.capacity_per_carriage.keys())
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown train type: {train_type}. Valid types are: {valid_types}")

    def calculate_capacity(self, passengers):
        """
        Calculate the total capacity of the train and determine if it is sufficient
        for the number of passengers.
        """
        # Fetch capacity per carriage based on train type
        capacity_per_carriage = self.capacity_per_carriage[self.train_type]
        total_capacity = self.carriages * capacity_per_carriage

        # Return whether the train has sufficient or insufficient capacity
        return "Sufficient" if passengers <= total_capacity else "Insufficient"

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_carriage_capacity(seats, passengers):
        """
        Determine if a single carriage's capacity is sufficient for the given number of passengers.
        """
        return "Sufficient" if passengers <= seats else "Insufficient"
```

**Explanation:**

- **`self.capacity_per_carriage`**:

  - A dictionary that stores the seating capacity per carriage for each train type.
  - **Why we do this**: To easily retrieve the capacity per carriage based on the train type.

- **Validation of `train_type`**:

  - Ensures that only known train types are used.
  - **Why**: Prevents errors due to typos or unsupported train types.

- **`calculate_capacity` Method**:

  - Calculates the total capacity and determines if it's sufficient for the given number of passengers.
  - **Why**: Encapsulates the logic for capacity assessment in a reusable method.

- **`calculate_carriage_capacity` Static Method**:

  - Determines if a single carriage can accommodate a certain number of passengers.
  - **Why**: Provides a utility function that can be used without needing an instance of `Train`.

**How to Run the Example:**

1. **Set Up Directory Structure**:

   ```
