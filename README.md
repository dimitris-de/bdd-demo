## Introduction to Acceptance Testing

**Acceptance Testing** is the final phase of the testing process before a release is deployed. It involves testing the software from the end-user's perspective to determine whether it meets the specified requirements and is ready for deployment.

### Why Is Acceptance Testing Useful?

- **Ensures Correct Functionality**: Verifies that all features work as intended and meet business needs.
- **Validates Integration**: Confirms that the software integrates well with existing systems and workflows.
- **Reduces Miscommunication**: Minimizes misunderstandings between developers and stakeholders by validating requirements.
- **Improves Usability**: Identifies usability issues that may not have been apparent during earlier testing phases.
- **Encourages Collaboration**: Promotes continuous collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

### Acceptance Testing as a Form of End-to-End Testing

Acceptance testing often involves end-to-end (E2E) scenarios to validate that the system meets business requirements in real-world conditions.

- **Acceptance Testing**: Emphasizes the user perspective, focusing on whether the system meets user needs and acceptance criteria.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Emphasizes the system perspective, focusing on the technical correctness of workflows across integrated components.

## Introduction to BDD

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is an Agile software development methodology that enhances collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on specifying the behavior of the application from the user's perspective.

### Key Principles

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Use a common language understood by all stakeholders to minimize miscommunication.
- **Executable Specifications**: Write tests that serve as both documentation and verification of the system's behavior.

## BDD as an Extension of TDD

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development approach where developers write unit tests before writing the actual code. 

**TDD** 
- The cycle is: **Write a failing test ➔ Write code to pass the test ➔ Refactor the code**.
- Focuses primarily on the **internal logic and code functionality**.

**BDD extends TDD by:** 

- Focusing on **user stories** and **acceptance criteria**.
- Writing tests in a natural language format (Gherkin syntax).
- Involving **business stakeholders** in the testing process.


##### **User Stories**

- **Definition**: A user story is a simple description of a feature from the end-user's perspective.
- **Format**: Often written in the format:
  - *As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value].*
- **Purpose**: Captures the **who**, **what**, and **why** of a requirement.

##### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **Definition**: Specific conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user or stakeholder.
- **Format**: Detailed requirements that are **testable** and **unambiguous**.
- **Purpose**: Define the **boundaries** of a user story and what is needed for it to be considered complete.

- **Complementary Components**: Acceptance criteria refine user stories by adding detailed conditions.
- **Example**:

  **User Story**:
  
  - *As an online shopper, I want to place items in a shopping cart so that I can purchase multiple items at once.*

  **Acceptance Criteria**:

  1. Users can add items to the cart from the product page.
  2. The cart updates the total price automatically when items are added or removed.
  3. Users can view all items in the cart before checkout.
  4. Users can adjust the quantity of each item in the cart.

- **Role in BDD**: These acceptance criteria are used to create **scenarios** in BDD that describe how the application should behave in various situations.

## What Is Behave?

**Behave** is an open-source BDD framework for Python that allows you to write tests in a natural language style using the Gherkin syntax. 

### Key Features

- **Gherkin Syntax**: Write test scenarios in plain English.
- **Python Step Definitions**: Implement test steps in Python.
- **Acceptance Testing Support**: Complements end-to-end testing by validating the system from the user's perspective, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.

### Example

**Feature File (`data_pipeline.feature`):**

```gherkin
Feature: Data Pipeline Validation

  Scenario: Successful data ingestion and transformation
    Given raw data is available in the S3 bucket
    When dbt models run
    Then the transformed data should be stored in the data warehouse
```

**Step Definitions (`data_pipeline_steps.py`):**

```python
from behave import given, when, then
import boto3
import dbt
import os

@given('raw data is available in the S3 bucket')
def step_given_raw_data_in_s3(context):
    #We can insert assertions here
    pass

@when('dbt models run')
def step_when_data_models_run(context):
    #We can insert assertions here
    pass

@then('the transformed data should be stored in snowflake')
def step_then_verify_data_in_snowflake(context):
    
    pass
```

## Installing and Using Behave

### Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then install Behave and necessary dependencies using `pip` or go to https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/ for more options:

```bash
pip install behave
```

### Directory Structure

An example of your project could be the following:

```
project/
├── features/
│   ├── data_pipeline.feature        # Feature files
│   └── steps/
│       └── data_pipeline_steps.py   # Step definitions
├── dbt/
│   └── models/                      # dbt models
├── src/
│   └── service/                     # Application code
└── .gitlab-ci.yml                   # CI/CD configuration
```

### Writing Feature Files

Feature files are written in Gherkin syntax with a `.feature` extension. They describe the desired behavior of your application, pipeline.

### Implementing Step Definitions

Step definitions are Python functions that correspond to steps in your feature files. They implement the behavior specified in the feature files.

### Running Tests

Execute your tests by running:

```bash
behave
```

## Use Cases in Data Engineering

### 1. Data Ingestion Validation

**Scenario:** Ensure that data is correctly ingested from AWS MSK (Kafka) into AWS S3 or other storage solutions.

**Feature File:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Validate data ingestion from Kafka
  Given data is published to the Kafka topic
  When the ingestion job runs
  Then the data should be available in the S3 bucket
```

### 2. Data Transformation with dbt

**Scenario:** Verify that dbt models transform data correctly according to business rules.

**Feature File:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Apply transformations using dbt models
  Given raw data is available in the data warehouse
  When dbt runs the models
  Then the transformed tables should reflect the business logic
```

### 3. Data Quality Checks with dbt-utils

**Scenario:** Use dbt-utils to ensure data quality and integrity.

**Feature File:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Check data quality using dbt-utils
  Given transformed data is ready
  When dbt runs the tests
  Then all data quality tests should pass
```

### 4. Orchestration with AWS MWAA

**Scenario:** Validate that the Airflow (MWAA) DAGs run successfully and produce expected outcomes.

**Feature File:**

```gherkin
Scenario: Execute MWAA DAGs for data pipeline
  Given the Airflow environment is set up
  When the scheduled DAG runs
  Then the data pipeline should complete without errors
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Feature Files

- **Clarity**: Use clear and concise language.
- **Focus**: Keep scenarios focused on a single behavior or functionality.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and terminology throughout.

### Collaboration

- **Involve Stakeholders**: Work with data analysts, engineers, and business stakeholders when writing feature files.
- **Regular Reviews**: Continuously review and update tests to reflect changing requirements and data models.

### Maintaining Tests

- **DRY Principle**: Avoid repeating code in step definitions.
- **Organization**: Group related features and steps logically in folders.
- **Version Control**: Store your tests in Git alongside your application code and dbt projects.
